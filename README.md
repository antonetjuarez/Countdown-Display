# Countdown-Display
Counts down from a selected number, displayed on a FPGA board with reset button

On FPGA, display starts with the final value of sum (which is 59 for the given
values in the register file), then stops at 09 which is the value of RegFile[15]. Each value is displayed for 1 second.
